## Introduction

LEGO Spike Prime is a flexible robotics platform aimed at helping students learn the basics of robotics and programming. This tutorial walks you through the process of setting up your kit, building a simple robot, and writing your first program.

## Gathering the Required Hardware

Make sure you have the LEGO Spike Prime set, which includes motors, sensors, and the programmable hub. You will also need a computer or tablet with the Spike app installed.

## Setting Up the Software

1. Download and install the LEGO Education Spike app from the official website.
2. Launch the app and update the hub firmware if prompted.
3. Familiarize yourself with the interface by exploring the example projects.

## Building Your First Robot

Follow the instructions provided in the kit to assemble a basic drive robot. The build usually involves attaching two motors for the wheels and connecting a sensor to the front of the robot.

## Programming Basics

1. Open the Spike app and create a new project.
2. Connect your hub via USB or Bluetooth.
3. Use the block-based interface to program simple movements, such as driving forward, turning, and stopping based on sensor input.
4. Download the code to the hub and test your robot.

## Next Steps

Once you are comfortable with the basics, experiment with more complex builds and programs. Explore using additional sensors or writing code in Python for greater flexibility.
