# Lesson 01: Motors and Color Sensor Basics

This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of controlling the LEGO Spike Prime motors and using the color sensor. The focus is on practicing block-based programming.

## Exercises

1. **Move Forward** - Program the robot to drive forward for one second.
2. **Move Backward** - Make the robot drive backward for one second.
3. **Turn Left** - Create a program that turns the robot 90 degrees to the left.
4. **Turn Right** - Create a program that turns the robot 90 degrees to the right.
5. **Stop at Color** - Drive forward and stop when the color sensor detects red.
6. **Light Up** - Use the color sensor's built-in light to change colors while moving.
7. **Reverse at Edge** - Drive forward until the color sensor detects black and then reverse.
8. **Spin in Place** - Program both motors to spin in opposite directions for a quick spin.
9. **Variable Speed** - Change the motor speed dynamically while driving forward.
10. **Short Delay** - Insert a one-second wait between two movements.
11. **Continuous Loop** - Run a loop to keep the robot driving forward until a button is pressed.
12. **Color Response** - Display a different light color on the hub for each color the sensor reads.
13. **Precise Distance** - Drive forward for a set number of motor rotations.
14. **Gradual Stop** - Slow down the motors gradually before coming to a stop.
15. **Dance Routine** - Combine several movements and color changes to create a simple dance.
